	<h2>A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee.Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks such as iced coffee and iced tea; in continental Europe, cafés serve alcoholic drinks.</h2><br>
	<p>The first coffee shop in England was set up in Oxford in 1651[20] by an Armenian man named Harutiun Vartian, also known as Pasqua or Pascal Rosée, at the Angel in the parish of St Peter-in-the-East. A building on or near the same site now houses a café-bar called The Grand Cafe.[21]<br> <br>Oxford's Queen's Lane Coffee House, established in 1654, is also still in existence today. The first coffeehouse in London was also established by the same Armenian, in 1652, in St Michael's Alley, Cornhill. The proprietor was Pasqua Rosée, the servant of a trader in goods from the Ottoman Empire named Daniel Edwards, who imported the coffee and assisted Rosée in setting up the establishment there.[22][23]

	<p>From 1670 to 1685, the number of London coffeehouses began to increase, and they also began to gain political importance due to their popularity as places of debate.[24] English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries were significant meeting places, particularly in London. By 1675, there were more than 3,000 coffeehouses in England.[25]</p>
